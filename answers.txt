What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a network git server (usually hosted on the cloud) that stores a
version of your and your colleagues local repositories. Changes are synced to this remote
repository via the git push command (which puts a local commit onto the remote) and is merged
from using the git pull command (which merges the commit from the remote onto the local
version of the git repository)
